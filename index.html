    <h1>The True Cost of a Meal</h1>
    <p>Discover the environmental impact of your food</p>
  </div>
  <div class=" section intro">
    <p>Every time you sit down to eat, you make a choice, not just about taste or health but also about the environment. 
    </p>
    <p>Making food is a process that consumes massive resources: land to grow crops, water to hydrate animals and process meat, fuel to transport goods across countries. It's a chain of actions that begins on farms and ends at your fork. Along the way, it pumps greenhouse gases into the air: cows digesting and farting in industrial farms, factories processing snacks, trucks rumbling toward your supermarket.</p>
    <p>So, how much does food impact our planet? How much is the coffee you’re drinking right now, reading these lines, contributing to environmental collapse?</p>
    <p>If you're here, perhaps you want to do something about it. After all, you live on planet Earth, and we think you care at least a little about it.But what can you do?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section introText">
    <h2>What’s Really On Your Plate?</h2>
    <p>
      Surely, having the chance to change the world by going to the supermarket and picking up the less impactful (and most delicious, we hope) food item is thrilling.
      But first, you need answers, or better, you need questions to be answered about what you eat.
    </p>
    <p>We asked a few key questions to help you and ourselves understand what’s really on your plate.</p>
    <h3>We started globally:</h3>
    <ul class="question-list">
      <li>What’s the environmental impact of food globally?</li>
      <li>How much water does the food sector use compared to others?</li>
      <li>Which sectors emit the most greenhouse gases?</li>
      <li>How much land is used to grow our food?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Then, we zoomed into Italy:</h3>
    <p>
      We believe in a world without boundaries, but cultural differences are beautiful and must be preserved. Consumption habits change from place to place. 
      That’s why we decided to focus on a single country, to understand what’s good and what’s bad about how we eat.
    </p>
    <p>We chose Italy, it’s where we come from. In the end, our questions arose from our own plates.</p>
    <ul class="question-list">
      <li>What are the most commonly consumed foods in Italy?</li>
      <li>What are their water and carbon footprints?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Looking forward:</h3>
    <p>
      We offer data-grounded substitutes to help reduce the environmental impact of your meals, without sacrificing taste.
      We also explore whether high-impact foods come with higher prices.
    </p>
    <p><strong>More money in your pocket, less burden on the planet.</strong></p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>Behind the scenes, there was a lot of work to turn messy numbers from different sources into clean, comparable, and meaningful insights.</p>
    <p>We took data from trusted sources like FAOSTAT, EFSA, and the FAO. Some of it was easy to download. Others — like food prices — had to be  <strong>scraped from websites</strong> . Once collected, we cleaned everything up, removed the irrelevant bits, and organized it all into neat tables.</p>
    <p>Every source had its own way of naming food. So, to  <strong>match "beef" with "cow meat"</strong>, we used a mix of smart algorithms and a powerful vocabulary from the FAO called  <strong>AGROVOC</strong>. This helped us connect the dots and make sure everything meant the same thing across datasets. When tech couldn’t do it,  <strong>we fixed it by hand. Because accuracy matters.</p>
    <p>We then filtered the data to focus on what’s relevant: solid foods with a significant environmental footprint. We also removed things like bottled water. This helped us build <strong>clear, readable charts </strong> and gave structure to the final interactive experience.</p>
    <p> <strong>And yes, we did it twice</strong>. Once to get a solid base with Italy’s most consumed foods. Then again, with more items, to spot patterns like whether <strong>eco-friendly food is also cheaper</strong>and to power the game at the end.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section two" id="world">
    <h2>The World</h2>
    <p>Before we dive into our meals let’s zoom out and ask:</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">How much does food impact our planet?</p>
    <p>As it turns out, it’s a lot. From the water and land used to grow our crops and livestock and the gas released during production, the food sector leaves one of the biggest footprints on Earth. </p>
    <p>Let’s see how it compares to other industries when it comes to water withdrawals, greenhouse gas emissions and land use</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section three">
    <div>
      <h4 class="cavText">water</h4>
      <h3>How much water does the food sector use compared to others?</h3>
      <p>Water scarcity is one of the major challenges our planet is facing and the way we produce food plays a big part. Around <strong>70% of global water withdrawals</strong> are used for agriculture and food systems, making it by far the most water-intensive sector in the world. That water goes into every stage of the process: <strong>irrigating crops, hydrating animals, processing raw ingredients</strong>, and <strong>cleaning equipment</strong> in factories. In comparison, industrial uses and household needs account for much smaller shares.
      </p>
      <p>To put it simply: food doesn’t just feed us. It drinks a lot, too.</p>
    </div>
    <div> 
      <h5>Agriculture leads global water withdrawal</h5>

    </div>

    </div>
    
  </div>

  <div class="section four">
      <h4 class="cavText">land</h4>
      <h3>How much land is used to produce food?</h3>
      <p>Almost half the planet is feeding us, quite literally.</p>
      <p>Nearly 40% of the world’s habitable land is used for agriculture. That’s a huge chunk of Earth’s surface devoted to growing crops and raising animals. Unlike factories or homes, food production needs space, a <em>lot</em> of it. Fields for wheat, orchards for fruit, pastures for livestock... all that land adds up.</p>
      <p>But this land hunger comes at a cost. Expanding farmland often means cutting down forests, destroying habitats, and pushing wildlife out. It’s one of the biggest drivers of biodiversity loss today.</p>
      <p>In this chart, you can see how global land is divided: from agricultural use to forests, cities, and other land types. Spoiler: food takes the biggest bite.</p>

      </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section five">
      <h4 class="cavText">co₂</h4>
      <h3>How much CO₂ is released by the food sector?</h3>
      <p>While energy and transportation often grab the headlines in climate talks, <strong>agriculture and food systems are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions</strong>, especially through <strong>livestock farming</strong> and <strong>crop production/strong>. Globally, the food sector is responsible for <strong>over 20% of total emissions</strong>, making it the <strong>second largest emitter after energy production</strong>. From methane released by cows to the fuel used for farming equipment and food transport, our meals leave a bigger carbon trail than most people realize.

      <h5>Your Meal Is a Major Polluter, Second Only to Power Plants</h5>

      <div class="zoom_container">

        <div>
          <svg id="food_zoom_chart"></svg>
        </div>
      </div>
    <p>As we can see in the chart, the <strong>process with the highest emissions is livestock production</strong> . And it’s no surprise: as you’ll see later, <strong>animal products have some of the highest carbon footprints</strong> . Interestingly, food <strong>transportation doesn’t contribute</strong>  nearly as much as people often think. So maybe it’s time to <strong>swap the slogan "eat local" with a new one: "eat plants."</strong> </p>

    <h2>What about Italy</h2>
    <p>After looking at the global picture, it’s time to bring the focus home. We decided to zoom in on Italy,  not just because it’s where we live (and eat), but because understanding local habits is the first step toward real change. What do Italians actually eat? Which foods weigh heaviest on the environment? And can our beloved espresso or extra virgin olive oil be part of a more sustainable future?</p>
    <p>Let’s find out what’s really cooking in Italian kitchens.</p>
