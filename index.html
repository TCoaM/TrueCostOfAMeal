    <h1>The True Cost of a Meal</h1>
    <p>Discover the environmental impact of your food</p>
  </div>
  <div class=" section intro">
    <p>Every time you sit down to eat, you make a choice, not just about taste or health but also about the environment. 
    </p>
    <p>Making food is a process that consumes massive resources: land to grow crops, water to hydrate animals and process meat, fuel to transport goods across countries. It's a chain of actions that begins on farms and ends at your fork. Along the way, it pumps greenhouse gases into the air: cows digesting and farting in industrial farms, factories processing snacks, trucks rumbling toward your supermarket.</p>
    <p>So, how much does food impact our planet? How much is the coffee you’re drinking right now, reading these lines, contributing to environmental collapse?</p>
    <p>If you're here, perhaps you want to do something about it. After all, you live on planet Earth, and we think you care at least a little about it.But what can you do?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section introText">
    <h2>What’s Really On Your Plate?</h2>
    <p>
      Surely, having the chance to change the world by going to the supermarket and picking up the less impactful (and most delicious, we hope) food item is thrilling.
      But first, you need answers, or better, you need questions to be answered about what you eat.
    </p>
    <p>We asked a few key questions to help you and ourselves understand what’s really on your plate.</p>
    <h3>We started globally:</h3>
    <ul class="question-list">
      <li>What’s the environmental impact of food globally?</li>
      <li>How much water does the food sector use compared to others?</li>
      <li>Which sectors emit the most greenhouse gases?</li>
      <li>How much land is used to grow our food?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Then, we zoomed into Italy:</h3>
    <p>
      We believe in a world without boundaries, but cultural differences are beautiful and must be preserved. Consumption habits change from place to place. 
      That’s why we decided to focus on a single country, to understand what’s good and what’s bad about how we eat.
    </p>
    <p>We chose Italy, it’s where we come from. In the end, our questions arose from our own plates.</p>
    <ul class="question-list">
      <li>What are the most commonly consumed foods in Italy?</li>
      <li>What are their water and carbon footprints?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Looking forward:</h3>
    <p>
      We offer data-grounded substitutes to help reduce the environmental impact of your meals, without sacrificing taste.
      We also explore whether high-impact foods come with higher prices.
    </p>
    <p><strong>More money in your pocket, less burden on the planet.</strong></p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>Behind the scenes, there was a lot of work to turn messy numbers from different sources into clean, comparable, and meaningful insights.</p>
    <p>We took data from trusted sources like FAOSTAT, EFSA, and the FAO. Some of it was easy to download. Others — like food prices — had to be  <strong>scraped from websites</strong> . Once collected, we cleaned everything up, removed the irrelevant bits, and organized it all into neat tables.</p>
    <p>Every source had its own way of naming food. So, to  <strong>match "beef" with "cow meat"</strong>, we used a mix of smart algorithms and a powerful vocabulary from the FAO called  <strong>AGROVOC</strong>. This helped us connect the dots and make sure everything meant the same thing across datasets. When tech couldn’t do it,  <strong>we fixed it by hand. Because accuracy matters.</p>
    <p>We then filtered the data to focus on what’s relevant: solid foods with a significant environmental footprint. We also removed things like bottled water. This helped us build <strong>clear, readable charts </strong> and gave structure to the final interactive experience.</p>
    <p> <strong>And yes, we did it twice</strong>. Once to get a solid base with Italy’s most consumed foods. Then again, with more items, to spot patterns like whether <strong>eco-friendly food is also cheaper</strong>and to power the game at the end.</p>

  <div class="section two" id="world">
    <h2>The World</h2>
    <p>Before we dive into our meals let’s zoom out and ask:</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">How much does food impact our planet?</p>
    <p>As it turns out, it’s a lot. From the water and land used to grow our crops and livestock and the gas released during production, the food sector leaves one of the biggest footprints on Earth. </p>
    <p>Let’s see how it compares to other industries when it comes to water withdrawals, greenhouse gas emissions and land use</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section three">
    <div>
      <h4 class="cavText">water</h4>
      <h3>How much water does the food sector use compared to others?</h3>
      <p>Water scarcity is a global issue and the way food is produced plays a major role. Agriculture and food systems account for around 70% of global water withdrawals, making it the most water-intensive sector on the planet. Industrial processes and municipal (household) uses follow far behind.
      </p>

      <h5>Agriculture leads global water withdrawal</h5>

    </div>
    
  </div>

  <div class="section four">
      <h4 class="cavText">land</h4>
      <h3>How much land is used to produce food?</h3>
      <p>Almost half of the planet’s habitable land is used for agriculture: almost 40% of global land is used for agriculture, including crops and pastures. Unlike industry or housing, food production needs vast open spaces, and this demand drives deforestation, habitat loss, and biodiversity decline.
      </p>
      <p>This chart breaks down how much land is used by agriculture, how much is covered by forests or used for other purposes (such as urbanization) .</p>

      </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section five">
      <h4 class="cavText">co₂</h4>
      <h3>How much CO₂ is released by the food sector?</h3>
      <p>While energy and transportation often steal the spotlight in climate discussions, agriculture and food systems contribute a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions, particularly through livestock, and crop production. Globally, the agriculture sector emits over 20% of total emissions, second only to energy production.
      </p>
      <p>This chart compares emissions across sectors, helping us see where food fits in the global picture.</p>
