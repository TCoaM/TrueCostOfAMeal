  <div class=" section intro">
    <p>Every time you sit down to eat, you make a choice, not just about taste or health but also about the environment. 
    </p>
    <p>This project explores the hidden environmental costs of our food to help change our consumption habits and improve our planet’s health. </p>

    <h2>The World</h2>
    <p>Before we dive into our meals let’s zoom out and ask:</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">How much does food impact our planet?</p>
    <p>As it turns out, it’s a lot. From the water and land used to grow our crops and livestock and the gas released during production, the food sector leaves one of the biggest footprints on Earth. </p>
    <p>Let’s see how it compares to other industries when it comes to water withdrawals, greenhouse gas emissions and land use</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section three">
    <h4 class="cavText">Water</h4>
    <h3>How much water does the food sector use compared to others?</h3>
    <p>Water scarcity is a global issue and the way food is produced plays a major role. Agriculture and food systems account for around 70% of global water withdrawals, making it the most water-intensive sector on the planet. Industrial processes and municipal (household) uses follow far behind.

<div class="section four">
    <h4 class="cavText">Land</h4>
    <h3>How much land is used to produce food?</h3>
    <p>Almost half of the planet’s habitable land is used for agriculture: almost 40% of global land is used for agriculture, including crops and pastures. Unlike industry or housing, food production needs vast open spaces, and this demand drives deforestation, habitat loss, and biodiversity decline.
    </p>
    <p>This chart breaks down how much land is used by agriculture, how much is covered by forests or used for other purposes (such as urbanization) .</p>

<div class="section five">
    <h4 class="cavText">CO₂</h4>
    <h3>How much CO₂ is released by the food sector?</h3>
    <p>While energy and transportation often steal the spotlight in climate discussions, agriculture and food systems contribute a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions, particularly through livestock, and crop production. Globally, the agriculture sector emits over 20% of total emissions, second only to energy production.
    </p>
    <p>This chart compares emissions across sectors, helping us see where food fits in the global picture.</p>
